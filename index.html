<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h1>Health data contains important knowledge that enables clinical research to assess treatment effect in real world settings. However, there are significant limitations: they are typically imbalanced across different population, diseases and interventions; they contain bias, noise and missing measurements; the process of removing patient identifiable information may take significant time and effort, which also faces the risk of deleting valuable information from the original data.
This project is designed to investigate an alternative approach to support clinical research through the use of synthetic data. We will study the feasibility of creating synthetic health data with the help of the latest AI technology, namely the generative AI, to  generate synthetic data that preserve the same value for research as real data. To answer the clinical questions about treatment effect,  our clinical trial emulation will run a “virtual trial” on the synthetic data. 
The goal of this project is to study the feasibility of this new approach through a specific use case in the context of Type 2 diabetes mellites  (T2DM). Through training the AI model with the SCI Diabetes data on Safe Haven, we aim to create their synthetic version and then we will carry out a virtual trial to assess the effect of a target medicine.  We will assess this new approach by comparing the outcomes from the trial emulation with the real ones.</h1>
