      <p>This research has a great potential in extrapolating outcomes from Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs).</p>
      <p>RCTs have long been considered as the ‘gold standard’ to inform clinical guidelines. However, they have significant limitations in external validity. The trial outcomes and conclusions are only directly applicable to the subjects involved in the studies, who might not be representative to the entire real-world population. Many individuals with vulnerable characteristics in the real-world are not well represented in RCTs. Consequently, this leaves a significant knowledge gap with no answers to many important clinical questions.</p>
      <p>Answers to many key clinical questions about people with multimorbidity and other perceived vulnerabilities can be found in real-world data that are routinely collected in clinical practices. Typically observational studies are involved to study the real world data.  However, contributions of the existing observational studies are hindered by many key barriers and bias within the data. Observational studies have inherent limitations in their ability to identify treatment effects due to their observational nature.</p>
      <p>The virtual trial emulation is an innovative evidence-based approach to extrapolate RCT outcomes using real-world data. They are interventional and support counterfactual emulations. Health professionals will be able to run emulations on their target population, examine the outcomes of the emulations and make a judgement on whether the effect sizes calculated from the emulations provide right answers about their clinical questions.</p>
      <p>The emulated trials offer high quality synthetic data that preserve the same value for research as the real datal. Compared with anonymised real data, synthetic data can address their main caveats including bias, data imbalance, noise and missing measurements. They are also in a much better position to overcome legal barriers in data protection and sharing.</p>
      <p>Overall, the virtual trial emulations offer a time /cost saving, and privacy-preserving solution to extrapolate RCT outcomes and a new way to provide real-world evidence to address target clinical questions  which would otherwise be impossible to address in  RCTs. This will open doors to a landscape change to revolutionise future biomedical and health research. Research in this direction will speed up timelines for clinical knowledge discovery, address complex problems in elderly population and multi-morbidity, and potentially transform regulatory and policy making process.</p>

      <p>The potential benefit of the new approach with synthetic health data include the following aspects:</p>
      <p> -	Quality of the data: This approach can generate synthetic data to address the problems that lie within the real data, including bias, data imbalance, noise and missing measurements.</p>
      <p> -	Research agenda:  Trial emulation can be tailored to create virtual populations to address target clinical questions via clinical trial emulations, which would otherwise be impossible to address in real-world trials. For example, the clinical questions that are associated with underrepresented populations of children, older adults, and patients with multi-morbidities and polypharmacy – these people are commonly excluded in clinical trials. In fact, Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are far from being able to answer all clinical questions. In many situations conducting RCTs with real patients is logistically challenging or unethical due to their potentially harmful nature. This leaves a significant knowledge gap. For example, a major drawback of the current clinical guidelines is that most of them only address single diseases with very few recommendations for multi-morbidity management despite the high prevalence.</p>
      <p> -	Privacy protection: Compared with anonymised real data (which contains reduced information about real patients),  this new approach can generate synthetic data in unlimited volume while containing no identifiable information about real individuals. Hence, this is in a much better position to overcome legal barriers in data protection and sharing.</p>
      <p> Overall, this research will assess the potentials of a new way to provide real-world evidence to support future clinical research with better quality and privacy protection. This will open doors for further research in this direction, which could ultimately bring a landscape change to revolutionise future biomedical and health research by broadening its research agenda, liberating its restrictions, saving cost and time. Research in this direction will speed up new timelines for treatment discovery, address increasingly complex healthcare landscape in elderly population and multi-morbidity, and potentially transform regulatory and policy making process. This will be fully aligned with the remit of Safe Haven by using health data to understand better the causes of disease, the effectiveness of drugs, or the impact of health services.</p>
      <p> Note, we do not claim that this single research will provide all the solutions and answers to this synthetic data approach and yield impact. Rather, it is a feasibility study to bring first set of evidence to assess whether this can be achieved by leveraging the latest AI technology – see more details below in the Methodology.</p>
