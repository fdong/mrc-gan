      <p>The potential benefit of the new approach with synthetic health data include the following aspects:</p>
      <p> -	Quality of the data: This approach can generate synthetic data to address the problems that lie within the real data, including bias, data imbalance, noise and missing measurements.</p>
      <p> -	Research agenda:  Trial emulation can be tailored to create virtual populations to address target clinical questions via clinical trial emulations, which would otherwise be impossible to address in real-world trials. For example, the clinical questions that are associated with underrepresented populations of children, older adults, and patients with multi-morbidities and polypharmacy – these people are commonly excluded in clinical trials. In fat, Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) are far from being able to answer all clinical questions. In many situations conducting RCTs with real patients is logistically challenging or unethical due to their potentially harmful nature. This leaves a significant knowledge gap. For example, a major drawback of the current clinical guidelines is that most of them only address single diseases with very few recommendations for multi-morbidity management despite the high prevalence.</p>
      <p> -	Privacy protection: Compared with anonymised real data (which contains reduced information about real patients),  this new approach can generate synthetic data in unlimited volume while containing no identifiable information about real individuals. Hence, this is in a much better position to overcome legal barriers in data protection and sharing.</p>
      <p> Overall, this research will assess the potentials of a new way to provide real-world evidence to support future clinical research with better quality and privacy protection. This will open doors for further research in this direction, which could ultimately bring a landscape change to revolutionise future biomedical and health research by broadening its research agenda, liberating its restrictions, saving cost and time. Research in this direction will speed up new timelines for treatment discovery, address increasingly complex healthcare landscape in elderly population and multi-morbidity, and potentially transform regulatory and policy making process. This will be fully aligned with the remit of Safe Haven by using health data to understand better the causes of disease, the effectiveness of drugs, or the impact of health services.</p>
      <p> Note, we do not claim that this single research will provide all the solutions and answers to this synthetic data approach and yield impact. Rather, it is a feasibility study to bring first set of evidence to assess whether this can be achieved by leveraging the latest AI technology – see more details below in the Methodology.</p>
